# Lab 4 – Turtle Graphics

## Purpose
This lab practices:
- turtle graphics commands
- algorithms with loops
- writing reusable functions

Detailed instructions and workflow guidance are provided in **Canvas**.

> Important: Turtle requires a graphical window.
> GitHub CodeSpaces will not work for this lab.

## Where to Code
You will likely write/test your code using:
- CodeHS “Python with Turtle”, or
- a local Python IDE

Then copy your finished code back into this repository for submission.

## Files
### TurtleGraphics.py
Implement the following functions:
- `drawPolygon(turtle, sides)`
- `fillCorner(turtle, corner)`
- `squaresInSquares(turtle, num)`

In `main()`, you can uncomment one test call at a time.

## Testing
Run each function and verify the drawing matches expectations.
